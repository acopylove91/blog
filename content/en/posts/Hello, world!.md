Hello. My name is Anton Kopylov. I'm a UX/UI designer since 2017.
This is my blog, where I will be sharing notes about the projects I'm involved in and simply thoughts about life and the events that have influenced me.
It will be a personal perspective, and it's perfectly okay not to agree with it.
