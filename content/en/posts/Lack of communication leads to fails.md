A little story about a project where I participated

# Project Overview

Task: Design the homepage of an online store specializing in sports apparel for both desktop and responsive platforms.

Situation:

1. The client provided functional requirements and a prototype he had personally assembled.
2. The designer refined the prototype, enhancing its clarity. However, the client was dissatisfied with this version and began altering requirements without formal documentation.
3. The manager failed to establish effective communication with the client and neglected to oversee the process of integrating revisions.
4. Regular design presentations were conducted through calls.
5. The designer became overwhelmed by the numerous revisions, lacking the experience to advocate for his design decisions.
6. The design process lacked structure, design requirements were not gathered from the client, and the systematic nature of solutions was disregarded.
7. Business analysis artifacts were absent.
8. Access to the metrics of the online store's website was unavailable.

Communication with the client was lacking, as was the presence of someone responsible for designing solutions. While there was a designer capable of creating graphical designs, he struggled to defend his design choices to the client.

# My Contribution to the Project

Over a span of 7 days, I assumed the role of the team lead on the project:
- I assigned tasks to the designer.
- I reviewed his work.
- I presented the outcomes to the client.
- I gathered feedback and opinions.
- I adapted the design concept for smartphone screens.

Guided by my direction, we formulated the design concept for the homepage, which was approved by the client.

# How the Project Went

I was invited to join a project and help ensure its successful completion due to tight deadlines. I got on board but rather than streamlining processes, I dove right into the work.

Within just 4 days, we finalized the concept for the main page and presented new project deadlines to the client. After that, we focused to dealing with UIkit and creating responsive layouts.

Subsequently, the client introduced suggestions to alter parts of the previously agreed-upon design concept. Two more days went by â€“ we were already immersed in crafting the UIkit and responsive layouts for smartphone screens based on the accepted concept. Meanwhile, the project manager remained passive, while the designer acted swiftly on the feedback, immediately integrating changes into the layouts.

Inquisitive about the rationale behind these desired alterations, given that the layouts had already been approved, I initiated a call. It emerged that the client's online store had a new director who aspired to participate in the website design and contribute their ideas. This inclination would be common among directors, wanting to exercise control over processes they are reliant on and for which they're investing.

At this juncture, my vacation concluded. I communicated to the team that I wouldn't be able to manage the project under such conditions. The team contemplated declining the assignment. In that moment, it struck me that due to inadequate communication among project leaders, revisions would likely continue without restraint, resulting in:
- an extension of the project timeline;
- uncertainty regarding the project's ultimate outcome.

# Project Outcomes

The project was not closed. The project manager became engaged and negotiated that no further revisions would be accepted for the agreed-upon concept. The remaining task for the designer was to complete the responsiveness and deliver the project.

# Lessons Gained from This Project

This project was a learning experience that exposed several mistakes, which I am confident have been extensively discussed in various articles.

- I failed to ascertain the identity of the decision-maker on the project.
- As it turned out, project managers from the client's side were part of our collaboration.
- In the interim between our discussions with them, they endorsed decisions that had been mutually agreed upon and presented these to their superiors, who introduced their own concepts and discarded ours.
- I neglected to clarify the scope of responsibility of the project manager.
- Once the project manager recognized my ability to present outcomes to the client and delegate tasks to the designer, they relinquished their oversight of the project.
- I omitted coordinating a team-wide meeting to elucidate my role and responsibilities on the project.
- The designer presumed that I would merely provide assistance, while the project manager envisioned me as a consultant and mentor for the designer. Recognizing the struggles of the primary designer and the project manager's limited involvement, I assumed the role of the lead designer in an effort to rescue the project.
- Rather than setting up procedural frameworks for the project, I promptly immersed myself in the work with the aim of propelling the project forward.

# Ideal Approach to Project Management

If the project could have been executed flawlessly, this is how I envisage it:

- Managers and the team communicate directly with the decision-maker on the client's side.
- If the decision-maker's schedule is congested, then a single weekly meeting is arranged.
- If the decision-maker holds pivotal significance, then an equally significant representative from the implementing side participates in the meeting.
- Revisions from product managers are only considered if they make decisions. In such instances, product managers serve as respondents during preliminary research and as sources of requirements if changes occur within the project scope.
- The project manager remains actively engaged, participating in every meeting where the final results of each project phase are presented, to validate and take on the subsequent task.
- Team members possess a clear understanding of their respective roles and responsibilities.
- At the project's outset, design requirements and pertinent data are gathered from the client.
- Succinct functional requirements prove insufficient. Every aspect must be discussed with the client, with redundant requirements identified and addressed before project work commences. Often, people assume they know what they want, only to realize, upon viewing results, that they actually desired something different, indicating that their aspirations were inaccurately framed. The aim is to assist the client in accurately defining the desired outcome from the outset.
- Ideally, conducting user research or having data from Yandex.Metrica or Google Analytics would offer insights into user behavior on the website. This data could highlight frequently visited sections and any encountered obstacles in achieving their objectives.
- If obtaining such data proves unfeasible, relying on the client's insights becomes necessary. In this scenario, seeking input from domain experts and crafting a product that better suits user needs remains viable.
- Following the analysis of research outcomes and their presentation to the client, there might be a reevaluation of priorities on their part. Consequently, they might require assistance in refining their vision of the outcome.
- This approach can avert futile efforts and prevent the client from investing in something that would eventually necessitate rework.
- Once research is complete and both parties share a clear vision of the outcome, prototyping, sketching, and ultimately designing can commence.
- This delineates the ideal process from my perspective. Your perspective might differ based on your experience.

Despite consulting articles and adhering to project management advice, I encountered the hazards of poor communication. The objective now is to avoid such pitfalls in the future.
